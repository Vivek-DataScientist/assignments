Prepare rules for the all the data sets 
1) Try different values of support and confidence. Observe the change in number of rules for different support,confidence values
2) Change the minimum length in apriori algorithm
3) Visulize the obtained rules using different plots 
BOOKS DATASET:-
In books dataset,i tried minimum length as 0.002 then formed 1673 support values,also lift has 93394 dataframes formed.In without redudancy 1661 dataframes are formed.
And I tried many small values in support.
In my analysis,I give minimum length as 0.03 then formed 181 support values,also lift has 1676 dataframes formed.In without redudancy 170 dataframes are formed.
